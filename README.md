## Project Overview
For my second project, since we are using and incorporating GIPHY into our websites this time. I thought it would be pretty cool to create a messaging application called "Talking Gif". That way I could try to pick up on some even more javascript learning if possible.
## Details/Functionality
I have created an application that allows you to send messages (containing the name of the message sender and timestamp that all go to the local storage and get saved until you clear the chat.) on top of the original assignment of incorporating GIPHY into the site. The GIPHY is fully functional in terms of finding either a random photo of what is searched. There is also a search button that will bring up 10 photos (at a time) of what the user places in the search bar. I have also managed to figure out how to change the color of the user that is selected. This site also has a quick and easy-to-use navigation bar at the top of the page that allows the user to get from either sending a message or sending a GIF (I was not able to figure out how to send the GIF's through in the messages. I also have a footer at the bottom that would lead to the company's social media accounts if the company were to exist.
## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
## Future Improvements
* I would like to add a way to send gifs back and forth to each other.
* I would like to add in a "add new feature" button.
* I would like to add more pages for the app that make it more usable.
* I would like to make a better way to combine both HTMLs (make a plus sign next to the send button that will change the regular message bar to a search bar for the gifs.).
* I would like to make the chat more responsive.
* I would like to add a "download the app" button.
* I would like to add a feautre that lets you add new contacts based on having each other as friends on other applications.
